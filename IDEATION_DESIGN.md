# Rag and Chat
## Problem To Solve
we are a company. Our company had developers and designers. we may have a new hire and that new hire may need to be ramped up?
- the new hire needs to be onboarded in a specific way
- the new hire needs to have access to the code base
- new hire needs to get ramed up fairly quickly with the curent code base
- this may require a lead engineer or mid level dev to take time out to ramp up the new hire
- this new hire may require the onboarding team to ramp them up on the workflow and general processes of the company
- this may require an entire team to take out time and ramp up the new hire

possible solution.
- rag on current company code base and store the code in a vector db. then to take the lead engineer out of the loop. add a simple chat bot that has the code base as its corpus of documents
- rag on company documentation and have a chat bot with the knowledge base of the company process and methodologies taking the onboarding team out of the loop to free up some time
